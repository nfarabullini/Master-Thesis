## Master-Thesis

This repository includes all code that was used for the Master Thesis.

This Master thesis aims at evaluating different similarity measures for body movement videos and creating an indexing structure for fast creation of a set of videos similar to a predefined query. 

**files_dances**: includes the filtered set of JSON files for the videos frames

**files_keyframes**: includes the full set of JSON files for the videos frames

**Dendrograms**: includes all Dendrograms created for all similarity methods

**horizontal_approach**: includes files for the DTW horizontal approach (by body parts angles), for Euclidean distance 

**vertical_approach**: includes files for the DTW vertical approach (by positions angles), for Euclidean distance, Cosine Similarity, and Past and Future vectors aprroach 

**lb_keough**: includes files needed to analyse the LB_Keough algorithm and find the optimal values of MBRs and Sakoe-Chiba lengths

**query_files**: includes files needed to create a set of videos similar to a predefined query
